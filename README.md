# NITM_SGPA
Hey, this is the source code of my first project.
This app is basically for the students of National Institute of Technology, Manipur. Its an obvious scene that when we attend a exam and are curious to know how will our performance affect our SGPA.
This is where this app comes in handy. It takes the input of your expected marks in subject and gives you your SGPA accordingly. Hope you like my beginner project.
